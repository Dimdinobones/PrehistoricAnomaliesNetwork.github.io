            <h2>PAN is a government-funded nature conservation organisation that aims to monitor the health and welfare of the prehistoric animals relocated from across the globe as a part of the world wide ban on prehistoric animals on protected ecosystems and wildlife preserves; this ban also extends to the ownership of prehistoric animals as domestic pets and public attractions. Our company founder, millionaire and paleontology fanatic Damien H Wesley, has purchased a private tropical island off the coast of The Bahamas, where the animals have thrived ever since witout human interaction. We have partnered with multiple countries to accomidate the new legislation as we intend to maintain the ecosystem of the isle by preventing human interference to ensure their wellbeing and saftey.</h2>

            <h3>While we admire Neozoic Labs' ambition and overall passion for prehistory, it was their ambition that led to their downfall. NL's CEO Bob Hammond recived funds for his operation from investors and private collectors who had initially shown interest in the CRIPSR: ADVANCED technology believing they could earn a fortune out of the cultural impact of the Jurassic Park/World films. This however became a financial and PR disaster as the company became bankrupt in late september of 2027 due to the high demand of food the animals required on a daily basis, and the 37 lawsuits relating to fatal workplace injuries as a result of mishandling the animals; the families of the deceased workers were not informed by Neozoic Labs until Hammond's trial on 13th Febuary 2029. It was later revealed that Bob Hammond has admited to selling schematics and blueprints of the CRISPR: ADVANCED technology to private owners and other companies just to keep the company afloat. Bob Hammond was later sentenced to life in prison on 18th May on the same year; with all of NL's assets being bought and owned by Wesley after the ban was placed.</h3>

            <h3>The lasting impact was disasterous as rival companies around the world have produced their own animals which have resulted in the increase of prehistoric anomalies across the globe. The animals' mere existence creates disruptions to the delicate balance of the ecosystems, and nature itself is far more complex than humans can understand where we are unable to see the lasting impacts and concequences of the slightest changes introduced. Prehistoric animals in the wild have led to the increase of competition between species as food sources such as vegetation and prey animals have dwindled, causing a massive chain reaction to the ecoystem as some organisms vital to that environment are fundementally replaced or erased by the presence of these invasive species. The presence of prehistoric animals has caused the increase of poaching; which has influenced trespassing onto private property and protected areas, as well as contribute to the increased sales of firearms. Prehistoric animals are illegal in most countries however they are often sold illegaly in the black market for high value for their rare meat or to be kept as domesticated pets for drug lords or private collectors. The government and PAN have aided in the closure of many black market sites however it is impossible to determine where else these animals have been kept hidden.</h3>

            <h3>PAN has started out with protest campaigns against Neozoic Labs before they became null and void, but now we are able to do so much more for these animals. In early 2030 Damien H Wesley bought out all of NL's assets and an island off the coast of The Bahamas to store them, Isla Lozano. The island has been our base of opperations as government task forces around the world have been deployed to capture and transport prehistoric animals to Isla Lozano; as well as shutting down companies that possess cloning technology similar to CRISPR: ADVANCED and reclaiming all their assets. where they are marked with a tracking chip that also measures their vitals; allowling us to monitor their health. We are also equipped with multiple survelance equipment, includingg state of the art aerial and aquatic spy-drones that are equipped with 4k cameras and eco-friendly batteries; these drones can also link with the implanted trackers so that they are able to find the animal's location and their pathing. The prehistoric animals are now under our care and we aim to create a sustaianable environment for them to live.</h3>

            <h3>Wesley has shown interest on buying more islands to accomidate for the other prehistoric animals that require unique living conditions. There are plans on setting up opperations on a remote desert island east of Egypt, and a tundra base North of Russia. These unqiue environments will help house organisms that are suited to living in arid or snowy ecosystems as we are currently unable to safley house certain animals on Isla Lozano; the majority of the prehistoric mammals on Isla Lozano have since fallen back to extinction due to their innability to adapt to the humid, dense jungle environment, as well as being constantly hunted down by the dominant predatory reptiles. Soon we will make a home for all of these prehistoric animals and we will keep them safe and far away from the human world.</h3>
