                <h2>Hylaeosaurus Armatus was an ankylosaur dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family that lived in the early Cretaceous period of England. It was around 20 feet long and weighing 2 tons; it was a broad, heavily armored herbivore that ate ground vegetation including ferns and horsetails in floodplians and wetlands. All but their undersides were covered in bony armor called osteoderms that would have protected them from larger predators. Hylaeosaurus slept by digging up holes in the ground and resting its body in them, only leaving their armored hides exposed.</h2>

                <h2>Rocky is the eldest surviving Hylaeosaurus on the Isle, having been born with a deformality where he had developed cataracts in his eyes, resulting in an impaired vision. This was unique only to Rocky as RedWood Ind, initially an exotic animal trafficking industry, produced them for the intent of creating their own zoo only to sell the majority of them to the black market. After their arrest and closure, the remaining 9 Hylaeosauruses were relocated to the Isle where their population has slowly increased over in the western wetland areas. Rocky was recorded to have mated with 3-4 females on the isle, produing a total of 13 viable offspring. Rocky lives mostly in solitude as he lives a peaceful life, adorning many scars from surviving numerous attempted predation, awaiting for the next mating season.</h2>
