                <h2>Megalosaurus Bucklandi was a theropod dinosaur of the Megalosauridae family that lived in the middle Jurassic period of southern England. It was around 20 feet long and weighing 1.1 tons; equipped with long, powerful hind legs for running, and a long, narrow skull that supported blade-like teeth for ripping the flesh off of their prey. It lived in lush, tropical forests where they would have served as the apex predators of their environment, preying on other dinosaurs including sauropods.</h2>

                <h2>Mary is a mother of two chicks who were born on the isle. Mary was property of Fossil Co, a fossil fuel company; along with five other Megalosauruses making her the youngest in her batch, where they were bred as a new method of producing fossil fuel. She was rescued on 21st May along with the other megalosauruses, however 001 and 004 died in quarantine due to tuberculosis. Strangely enough, her babies: 007 & 008, share 100% of their DNA to Mary, suggesting that Mary went through Parthogenesis; meaning that Mary produced offspirng without a male. 002 is also a female but does not share this trait as her offspring only share 50% of her DNA, leading to a theory that Mary was a unique experiment seperate from the others. Her nest is located near the coastal regions of the isle where Mary lives in solitude with her chicks named "Bella" and "Kim"; as the megalosaurus population slowly stablizses.</h2>
